## TO-DO
Fix this --> X-ing out of sort-modal or search-modal resets myLibrary to hardcoded initial books.

Fix this --> Click read and fave button in main default view mode does not alter their respective read or fave status in myLibrary.

Fix this --> Commented out pages read and pages not read calculations due to wonky additional numbers being added to total. Possibly come back to this, adding it was just an initial first idea and might not be adding enough value to implement. 

Fix this --> Text of book sometimes disappears in edit-book form.
